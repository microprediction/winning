# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Place/show calibration: `abilities_from_topk` inverts a top-k
  membership curve (any depth, logit residuals against the saturated
  favorites, factor rank <= 2); exact-rank targets are refused as
  standalone inputs (two-branched) with `abilities_from_rank_marginal`
  as the eyes-open branch-picking alternative.
- Two-parameter calibration: `loc_scale_from_topk_pair` and the
  market-facing `loc_scale_from_win_and_second` jointly identify per
  runner (location, scale) from two membership curves on the exact
  stacked (dq/dmu, dq/dsigma) Jacobians — square on the double gauge
  quotient (translation, joint rescaling), optional log-sigma ridge
  (`ridge=` multiplies the squared penalty) and warm start (`mu0=`).
- JS and R ports of the full top-k module (forward, both Jacobians,
  rank marginals, all three inversions), parity-locked: 15 new embedded
  scenarios match the python reference at ~1e-15 in both languages.
- `winning.factor.topk` now honors `WINNING_PURE` like races/blocks.
- fastrace kernels for the inversion hot passes: `top_k_slopes`,
  `top_k_jacobians` and `top_k_window` (the python bisection was ~2.6 ms
  of a ~5 ms small-field forward), with the rayon fan-out gated on a
  work estimate so small fields run serial. Measured at n = 9:
  loc_scale_from_win_and_second 48 -> 4.5 ms/race, abilities_from_topk
  13 -> 2.4 ms/race; kernels match numpy at 1e-12 on the shared window.
- loc/scale warm start runs at loose tolerance (the LM loop refines);
  mirrored in the JS and R ports so parity trajectories agree.
- Julia joins the parity lock: `julia/winning` (dependency-free but for
  stdlib LinearAlgebra) ports the factor races (forward, slopes,
  inversion, adaptive quadrature) and the complete top-k module; all 24
  in-scope scenarios of `parity/check.jl` match the python reference at
  machine precision. Blocks/nested/tree, polish and the classic lattice
  remain the Julia roadmap.
- fastrace rank-marginal kernels (`rank_marginals`,
  `rank_marginal_jacobian`); `abilities_from_rank_marginal` drops from
  14.5 to 2.7 ms/race at n = 9. The pinning test caught an r = n defect
  in every language: the Jacobian's P(N = n-1) term is identically zero
  but was computed as window-sensitive deconvolution junk; all four
  implementations now use the identity.
- `top_k_jacobians` accepts factor correlation (`V=`, rank <= 2) as an
  exact Gauss-Hermite mixture of independent Jacobians, in python and
  both ports; `loc_scale_from_topk_pair` REFUSES fixed loadings with
  the dimension count (no rescaling gauge means two curves carry
  2n - 2 numbers against 2n - 1 unknowns — a third depth would close
  it as overdetermined least squares).
- `winning.thurstone` renamed `winning.research` (honest labeling of
  research-grade machinery); the old name remains as a
  `DeprecationWarning` alias that also serves submodule imports.

- Dense-covariance front door: `race_probabilities(mu, cov=Sigma)` and
  `winning.factor.core.fit_covariance(Sigma, k, m)` package the paper's
  dense pipeline (certified quotient factor fit, blocks and residual
  promotion on the projected residual, closing `(P∘P) d = diag(P R P)`
  diagonal solve). In-grammar inputs are returned undistorted.
- Grammar-wide inversion: `abilities_from_race` accepts `structure=` and
  `cov=`; blocks/nested/tree invert through the exact forward dispatch
  with a damped, variance-matched-preconditioner fixed point.
- `factor_model_projected` D-step collapsed to its n-dimensional normal
  equations (Gram is exactly `P∘P`): 67 s → 0.27 s at n=300, identical
  minimizer.
- The classic lattice API moved to `winning.classic`; the old top-level
  imports keep working as aliases that raise a `DeprecationWarning`.

## 1.2.0 (2026-08-27)

The structured-covariance engine.

- One race, five covariance grammars: `Independent`, `Factor`, `Blocks`,
  `Nested`, `Tree` dataclasses accepted as `structure=` by the front-door
  verbs; `Tree.from_linkage(Z)` builds the race whose implied correlation
  is exactly the (floored) cophenetic matrix of a hierarchical clustering.
- Block, nested and tree kernels with exact block/nested Jacobians, an
  (approximate-across-clusters) tree Jacobian, and hybrid fixed-point +
  Newton inversion (`abilities_from_block_race`).
- `polish_race`: the nearest race satisfying linear constraints on
  probabilities (concentration caps), with a finite-difference fallback
  when the analytic Jacobian is approximate.
- Winner-bulk lattice window: 3-4x narrower lattices at equal guarantee;
  default `points` lowered to 257. `window="span"` preserves old behavior.
- Sharpness-adaptive factor quadrature: the default Gauss-Hermite order
  now scales with max ||V_i||/sqrt(D_i) (a fixed 15-node rule silently
  lost up to 5% total variation on sharp fields).
- Sharp-field rescue in `core.win_probabilities_factor`: fields whose
  density spikes fall between span-window lattice points retry once
  through the bulk-window front door instead of raising.
- Compiled kernels: `pip install winning[fast]` pulls the `fastrace`
  abi3 wheels (pyo3 over the pure-rust `winning` crate); every python
  path keeps a numpy fallback that remains the spec. `WINNING_PURE=1`
  or `winning.use_rust(False)` forces pure python.
- Parity harness: `parity/vectors.json` embeds inputs and outputs of 22
  scenarios; Python (reference), R, Rust and JavaScript replay them, most
  at machine precision.
- Base-R package (`r/winning`, v0.3.0) and a zero-dependency browser
  port (`docs/js/winning`) mirror the full API.

## 1.1.1

- N=2 inversion closed form; damping 0.7 for general bases at N=2.
