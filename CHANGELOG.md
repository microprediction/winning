## 1.2.0 (2026-08-27)

The structured-covariance engine.

- One race, five covariance grammars: `Independent`, `Factor`, `Blocks`,
  `Nested`, `Tree` dataclasses accepted as `structure=` by the front-door
  verbs; `Tree.from_linkage(Z)` builds the race whose implied correlation
  is exactly the (floored) cophenetic matrix of a hierarchical clustering.
- Block, nested and tree kernels with exact block/nested Jacobians, an
  (approximate-across-clusters) tree Jacobian, and hybrid fixed-point +
  Newton inversion (`abilities_from_block_race`).
- `polish_race`: the nearest race satisfying linear constraints on
  probabilities (concentration caps), with a finite-difference fallback
  when the analytic Jacobian is approximate.
- Winner-bulk lattice window: 3-4x narrower lattices at equal guarantee;
  default `points` lowered to 257. `window="span"` preserves old behavior.
- Sharpness-adaptive factor quadrature: the default Gauss-Hermite order
  now scales with max ||V_i||/sqrt(D_i) (a fixed 15-node rule silently
  lost up to 5% total variation on sharp fields).
- Sharp-field rescue in `core.win_probabilities_factor`: fields whose
  density spikes fall between span-window lattice points retry once
  through the bulk-window front door instead of raising.
- Compiled kernels: `pip install winning[fast]` pulls the `fastrace`
  abi3 wheels (pyo3 over the pure-rust `winning` crate); every python
  path keeps a numpy fallback that remains the spec. `WINNING_PURE=1`
  or `winning.use_rust(False)` forces pure python.
- Parity harness: `parity/vectors.json` embeds inputs and outputs of 22
  scenarios; Python (reference), R, Rust and JavaScript replay them, most
  at machine precision.
- Base-R package (`r/winning`, v0.3.0) and a zero-dependency browser
  port (`docs/js/winning`) mirror the full API.

## 1.1.1

- N=2 inversion closed form; damping 0.7 for general bases at N=2.
